<font color="deepskyblue"><h1>Criticisms & Risks</h1></font>
<p>
<b>Attagging:</b> Malicious code can be transmitted through the innocent-looking square because anyone can create codes, and anyone with the reader is able to scan them. These attacks can potentially access contacts and photos stored on the device.
</p>
<p>
<b>Link to anything:</b> The QR code can be linked to anything you tell it to be. A "funny guy" can link the code to a porn site and then place the code as stickers throughout public parks. You are trusting the creator, and sometimes that trust is broken or untrue.
</p>
<p>
<b>Used excessively:</b> Codes can be used too much in an attempt to make the user appear "tech-savvy". They are also often placed in poor and inaccessible locations, such as the side of a building, a subway station, billboard, parade float, and even a pair of shoes. 
</p>
Poor execution is what gives QR codes a bad reputation.<br>
