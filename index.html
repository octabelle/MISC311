<h1>History</h1>
<b>Japan, 1960's, economic boom in markets:</b> Cashiers suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome from repeated manual-entry of prices of 
items being sold. Barcodes were invented to provide a solution - they made scanning easier through a simple, single motion, but
there were limitations, such as the 20 character limit of information that the barcode could hold.
<p><b>DENSO WAVE INC.</b>: A Toyota subsidiary DENSO developed barcode readers at the time. They were asked to develop a new 
barcode that could hold more information - users requests that Kanji characters and alphanumeric ones could be used. This required improving the 
one-directional barcode to become a 2D code, where information is stored up-and-down, providing more room for information.<br>
Also, the codes needed to have incredibly unique position detection patterns. This would avoid the code looking similar to 
another markign nearby. DENSO came up with the ratio <i>1:1:3:1:1</i> by reviewing several magazines, fliers, boxes, etc. and 
determining the ratio of white to black areas in symbols and photos. The ratio also allowed for 360&deg; angle scanning, 
which made the code readable no mayyer what the orientation is. 
<h1>QR Debut</h1>
<p>
<b>1994, reveal of the QR Code:</b> DENSO released the <i>Quick Response</i>, or QR, Code, capable of storing encoded data that
can be interpreted as numeric, alphanumeric, byte, and Kanji. It could hold a much larger amunt of information compared to its
predecessor and could be read more than 10 times as fast.
