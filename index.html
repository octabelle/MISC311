<font color="DeepSkyBlue"><h1>History</h1></font>
<font size="14"><b>Japan, 1960's, economic boom in markets:</b></font> Cashiers suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome from repeated manual-entry of prices of 
items being sold. Barcodes were invented to provide a solution - they made scanning easier through a simple, single motion, but
there were limitations, such as the 20 character limit of information that the barcode could hold.
<p><b>DENSO WAVE INC.</b>: A Toyota subsidiary DENSO developed barcode readers at the time. They were asked to develop a new 
barcode that could hold more information - users requests that Kanji characters and alphanumeric ones could be used. This required improving the 
one-directional barcode to become a 2D code, where information is stored up-and-down, providing more room for information.<br>
Also, the codes needed to have incredibly unique position detection patterns. This would avoid the code looking similar to 
another markign nearby. DENSO came up with the ratio <i>1:1:3:1:1</i> by reviewing several magazines, fliers, boxes, etc. and 
determining the ratio of white to black areas in symbols and photos. The ratio also allowed for 360&deg; angle scanning, 
which made the code readable no mayyer what the orientation is. 
<h1>QR Debut</h1>
<p>
<font size="14"><b>1994, reveal of the QR Code:</b></font> DENSO released the <i>Quick Response</i>, or QR, Code, capable of storing encoded data that
can be interpreted as numeric, alphanumeric, byte, and Kanji. It could hold a much larger amunt of information compared to its
predecessor and could be read more than 10 times as fast. </p>
<p>The code was adopted by the auto industry. It made management's work more efficient in each level, from packaging slip
creation to shipping to production. They could track vehicles as they assembled and scan the components at higher speeds.</p>
<p>QR codes are available to everyone, as the creator intended, under a free license. The popularity spread across the world.
There are several generators online and as well as a feature in Adobe InDesign that allows you to create the codes.
